# TOP_MessageBoard_CF_HONO
Message Board app for The Odin Project NodeJS curriculum.
Completed using Cloudflare Workers, and Hono rather than Node JS, Express, and EJS.
Reason for the prefered stack is to deploy on Cloudflare and utilise their technology in one cloud provider including workers on the edge, D1, R2, etc.
